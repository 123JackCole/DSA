# How to use these questions

Repetition is key when it comes to algorithms.
Use these 100+ questions as a tool to continue your learning and get better at solving interview questions.

Keep in mind the tips from the [Whiteboard workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6UWAZ0YAHTw&list=PLc6AmvC5Zybz038jznOLFk9XHFcIeo1VK&index=10) so that you can drill these like you would in an interview (ex. thinking through edge cases) and consider pairing up with others to do practice mock interviews.
